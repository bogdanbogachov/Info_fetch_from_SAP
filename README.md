# Info_fetch_from_SAP
This tool was designed in VBA to manipulate a certain SAP transaction and fetch all results this transaction returns during each iteration.

This SAP transaction is used in order to find specific information pertaining to a specific product; however, the problem with this transaction is that it has to be supervised and a user does not have an opportunity to run it for multiple products automatically. This tool solves this problem allowing a user to enter necessary parameters in a user form, submit the tool execution and obtain all required results from SAP automatically.

P.S. some parameter names were changed for confidentiality purposes.
